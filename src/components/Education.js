                <p>I enrolled at the University of Johannesburg in 2020, and I have successfully completed up to my second-year curriculum.
                    <br />
                    During my university years, I managed to learn how to write reusable software, code in 
                    object-oriented programming using C++ and Java, and design full-scale applications using standard object-oriented design patterns. Additionally, I gained knowledge in designing and developing relational databases in MySQL

                <p>While studying at UJ, I also dedicated some of my time to learning web technologies.
                    <br />
                    I started with web development fundamentals courses that I purchased on Udemy, an online learning platform. With more practice,
                     I later began learning frameworks and libraries through structured courses on YouTube to expand my knowledge and keep up with the technologies used in web development production.
